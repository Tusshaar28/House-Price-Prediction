# House Price Prediction and Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices and analyzing factors that affect them based on various features in a dataset. The project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices and visualizing the relationships between different features, such as size and location.

## Features

- **House Price Prediction**: Utilizes a trained model to predict house prices based on features such as size, location, and number of bathrooms.
- **Data Analysis**: Includes graphical representations to analyze the impact of different features on house prices.
